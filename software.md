### PePr 
PePr is a ChIP-seq peak-calling and differential binding tool that I developed in Sartorlab when I was a PhD student.PePr's source code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/shawnzhangyx/PePr). 

### OmicsPedia
I found the online resources for analyzing Next-Gen Sequencing data are very scattered. Although there are some forums and communities such as biostar and SeqAnswer that offer valuable answers to questions, it's still hard for people who begin to explore certain analysis pipelines. Therefore, I'm trying to create an online bioinformatics knowledgebase that assembles up-to-date analysis tutorials and other info that could benefit bioinformatics learners. This project is ongoing and can be found <a href="https://ones.ccmb.med.umich.edu">here</a>.
