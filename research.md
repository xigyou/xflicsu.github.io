### Bioinformatics
I am broadly interested in all kinds of biomedical research that involves challenges in data analysis. I love developing computational solutions (software) for these problems and applying them on real data. I believe that the ability to comprehensively analyze "big data" is a very important step towards understanding this complex system.

### Epigenetics and gene regulation

The 1D genome (DNA sequence) has been determined and studied for over a decade. However, the complex transcriptional program has yet to be fully understood. A lot of "evil" organismal malfunctions (such as cancer) originate from or innitiate dramatic changes in the transcription, however it is unclear how this is achieved. There is a primary need to decode the rule of gene regulation. 

### Aging 
Isn't it fascinating that nearly all living organisms are doomed to ageing and death, while our DNAs continue to thrive in the blood of our offsprings? Is this simply a survival strategy/natural selection, or an instrinsic defect in our system that can never be fixed? 

### Open Sicence ###
I love the idea of open science. Open data and scripts. I think it is very important to share these, as it is a way for others to more easily replicate your findings.
